## **Key Implementations**

### **1. Secure User Authentication**
- **Login System**: Users can log in securely using their email, password, and role (user/admin).
- **Signup System**: New users can register with their full name, email, password, and role.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using `password_hash()` and verified using `password_verify()`.

### **2. Software Metrics and Logging**
- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks metrics like:
  - `error_count`: Number of errors encountered.
  - `query_count`: Number of database queries executed.
  - `execution_time`: Total time taken for script execution.
  - `failure_type`: Types of failures (e.g., invalid email, weak password).
  - `validation_time`: Time taken for input validation.
  - `db_query_time`: Time taken for database queries.
- **Structured Logging**: Logs metrics in a structured JSON format for easier analysis.

### **3. Role-Based Access Control**
- **User Roles**: Users can log in as either `user` or `admin`.
- **Role-Based Redirection**:
  - Users are redirected to the `services.php` page.
  - Admins are redirected to the `admin_dashboard.php` page.

### **4. Responsive Design**
- The platform is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).


## **Future Plans**
1. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Implement **data encryption** for sensitive information.
   - Add **CAPTCHA** or **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for secure login.
2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize database queries and reduce page load times.
   - Implement caching mechanisms for faster access to static resources.
3. **Mobile Application**:
   - Develop a mobile app version of MHARS for easier access on the go.
4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add **AI-based mental health assessments**.
   - Integrate **live chat support** with mental health professionals.
